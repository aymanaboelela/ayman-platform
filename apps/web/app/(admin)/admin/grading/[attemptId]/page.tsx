/**
 * One paper, marked.
 *
 * ## A page, not a dialog over the queue
 *
 * The same call `/admin/homework` made and for the same reason: what has to be
 * decided is a question stem and a written answer read at a size, per question,
 * with a mark and a note typed against each one. A modal over a list gives that
 * a scrollbar inside a scrollbar.
 *
 * ## `adminGetOrNotFound`
 *
 * An attempt id from a tab left open since yesterday, or one whose student
 * deleted their account, is a MISSING ROW — an ordinary outcome. `adminGet`
 * throws on every non-2xx and an unhandled throw in a Server Component is a 500
 * under `error.tsx`, so it would read «حصل خطأ» and be indistinguishable from a
 * broken endpoint. Only 404 is translated; a 401 or a 500 still throws, because
 * dressing a fault up as a missing row is how a dead route becomes an invisible
 * empty page. See the note in `lib/admin-api.ts`.
 *
 * The payload carries the student's written answer and the question stem, so it
 * is `attempt:grade` on the API side — admin-only, re-authorised there. This
 * page forwards the session cookie and decides nothing.
