/**
 * No `<Card>` any more. The form sits directly on the split screen's form
 * column: a card inside a column that is already visually distinct from the
 * panel beside it is a box drawn around a box, and its `bg-surface-2` fill was
 * also what made the old dark-gradient shell look like two unrelated screens
 * stacked on each other.
 *
 * `?next=` is read HERE, in the Server Component, and validated once by
 * `safeNext` before it reaches anything that renders or navigates. Reading it
 * in the client form via `useSearchParams()` instead would drag this route into
 * a Suspense boundary it does not otherwise need, and would leave an
 * unvalidated value one careless line away from a `router.push` — on the page a
 * visitor is most primed to trust. The sibling `loading.tsx` already provides
 * the boundary awaiting `searchParams` needs.

/**
 * The provider round trip's failure codes, mapped to something a student can
 * act on.
 *
 * Better Auth appends `?error=<code>` to whatever `errorCallbackURL` the
 * sign-in request carried (`oauth2/errors.mjs:12`), and
 * `components/auth/auth-providers.tsx` now points that at this page. Before
 * it did, the fallback was `${baseURL}/error` — the library's own bare English
 * page, under `/api/auth/`, with no nav and no way back.
 *
 * `account_not_linked` is the one that actually happens on this platform, and
 * it is not an outage: Better Auth refuses to link a social login onto a local
 * account whose `emailVerified` is false, and with no email-verification flow
 * anywhere in the product that is EVERY account created with a password. So
 * the copy names the way in — use the password — rather than apologising for a
 * failure the student cannot do anything about.
 *
 * Everything else collapses to one generic line. The set of codes Better Auth
 * can emit is long, provider-specific and not stable across versions, and a
 * student has no use for the difference between `invalid_code` and
 * `unable_to_get_user_info`.
 *
 * Read as a plain string and never rendered — only ever used to CHOOSE between
 * two copy constants, so a crafted `?error=` cannot put text on the page.
